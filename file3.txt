Mid-day Mood | Nifty, Sensex trade flat as IT, Media stocks drag; focus on FOMC minutes
The resilient domestic buying is providing the main support to the rally in the market, and the strong performance of the economy and improving corporate earnings are also a solid fundamental support to the markets, according to analysts.

Globally, investors await the release of US FOMC meeting minutes as this would provide some insights into the US Fed’s future direction.

The benchmark Sensex and Nifty indices were trading flat on February 21 after the Nifty hit an all-time high of 22,248 in the morning deals. Correction in Media and IT stocks dragged the headline indices down by noon, but gains in metal stocks offset the losses.

According to market observers, the BSE market cap touching a record high of $4.7 trillion is showing strength in the market.

Analysts expect market sentiment to strengthen further as the prospect of a pre-election rally is quite strong. Globally, investors await the release of US FOMC meeting's minutes later on Wednesday as that would provide some insights into the US Fed’s future direction.

At 11:45 am, the Sensex was up 64.59 points or 0.09 percent at 73,122, and the Nifty was up 16.00 points or 0.07 percent at 22,21. About 1,589 shares advanced, 1,625 declined, and 74 were unchanged.
